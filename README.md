# Cricket_Analysis-and-Prediction-system

# Project Overview

This repository contains various components for image classification and predictive modeling related to cricket match outcomes. Below is a summary of the folder structure and contents:

## Folder Structure

### `CNN_Runout/`

This folder contains datasets and code related to image classification for predicting "out" and "not out" scenarios.

- **`Dataset/`**: Contains images split into training and validation folders for both "out" and "not out" categories.
- **`Practice_Work`**: Contains preliminary work and experiments related to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
- **`CNN_Final`**: Contains the final code for CNN models used to classify images.

### `Match_Prediction/`

This folder contains models for predicting cricket match outcomes.

- **`ODI_Model`**: Contains a Decision Tree model trained on One Day International (ODI) match data.
- **`T20_Model`**: Contains a Random Forest model trained on Twenty20 (T20) match data.

### `Data_Analysis/`

This folder includes Streamlit apps for exploratory data analysis.

- **`index.py`**: Contains the Streamlit app files for data analysis and visualization of odi.
- - **`t20.py`**: Contains the Streamlit app files for data analysis and visualization of t20.


### `Final_Streamlit/`

This folder contains the final Streamlit application which integrates all models and analyses.
- **Supporting Files**: Note that supporting files such as saved models and label encoders are not included in this repository. You can download these files from the following link:
